Statistical analysis of trait Kernel length/breadth ratio and amylose content of rice accessions from GRIN
Input file- Rice_GRIN_Global.csv
R version 4.4.0 was used and ggplot2 package was used t generate the scatter plot and histogram
The task was executed on HPC using Sallac method.
Summary based on resulting plots
Summary - The histogram and box plot shows the distribution of kernel length/width ratios across rice accessions. A large number of accessions have a ratio close to 0, likely reflecting missing or invalid measurements, while the valid values are mainly concentrated between 1.5 and 3.5, peaking around 2.0â€“2.5. This indicates that most rice accessions fall within a moderate kernel shape range, with fewer accessions having very elongated (higher ratio) or very short (lower ratio) kernels.
